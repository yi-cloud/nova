.. _Boot_instance_from_ISO_image:

Boot an instance from an ISO image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack supports booting instances using ISO images. But before you
make such instances functional, use the :command:`openstack server create`
command with the following parameters to boot an instance:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack server create --image ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso \
     --nic net-id = NETWORK_UUID \
     --flavor 2 INSTANCE_NAME

In this command, ``ubuntu-14.04.2-server-amd64.iso`` is the ISO image,
and ``INSTANCE_NAME`` is the name of the new instance. ``NETWORK_UUID``
is a valid network id in your system.

Create a bootable volume for the instance to reside on after shutdown.

#. Create the volume:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack volume create \
        --size <SIZE_IN_GB> \
        --bootable VOLUME_NAME

#. Attach the instance to the volume:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack server add volume
        INSTANCE_NAME \
        VOLUME_NAME \
        --device /dev/vda

.. note::

   You need the Block Storage service to preserve the instance after
   shutdown. The ``--block-device`` argument, used with the
   legacy :command:`nova boot`, will not work with the OpenStack
   :command:`openstack server create` command. Instead, the
   :command:`openstack volume create` and
   :command:`openstack server add volume` commands create persistent storage.

After the instance is successfully launched, connect to the instance
using a remote console and follow the instructions to install the
system as using ISO images on regular computers. When the installation
is finished and system is rebooted, the instance asks you again to
install the operating system, which means your instance is not usable.
If you have problems with image creation, please check the
`Virtual Machine Image Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/create-images-manually.html>`_
for reference.

.. _Make_instance_booted_from_ISO_image_functional:

Make the instances booted from ISO image functional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now complete the following steps to make your instances created
using ISO image actually functional.

#. Delete the instance using the following command.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack server delete INSTANCE_NAME

#. After you delete the instance, the system you have just installed
   using your ISO image remains, because the parameter
   ``shutdown=preserve`` was set, so run the following command.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack volume list
      +--------------------------+-------------------------+-----------+------+-------------+
      | ID                       | Display Name            | Status    | Size | Attached to |
      +--------------------------+-------------------------+-----------+------+-------------+
      | 8edd7c97-1276-47a5-9563- |dc01d873-d0f1-40b6-bfcc- | available |   10 |             |
      | 1025f4264e4f             | 26a8d955a1d9-blank-vol  |           |      |             |
      +--------------------------+-------------------------+-----------+------+-------------+

   You get a list with all the volumes in your system. In this list,
   you can find the volume that is attached to your ISO created
   instance, with the false bootable property.

#. Upload the volume to glance.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack image create --volume SOURCE_VOLUME IMAGE_NAME
      $ openstack image list
      +-------------------+------------+--------+
      | ID                | Name       | Status |
      +-------------------+------------+--------+
      | 74303284-f802-... | IMAGE_NAME | active |
      +-------------------+------------+--------+

   The ``SOURCE_VOLUME`` is the UUID or a name of the volume that is attached to
   your ISO created instance, and the ``IMAGE_NAME`` is the name that
   you give to your new image.

#. After the image is successfully uploaded, you can use the new
   image to boot instances.

   The instances launched using this image contain the system that
   you have just installed using the ISO image.
