    The Compute service has never supported direct booting of an instance from
    an image that was created by the Block Storage service from an encrypted
    volume.  Previously, this operation would result in an ACTIVE instance that
    was unusable.  Beginning with this release, an attempt to boot from such an
    image will result in the Compute API returning a 400 (Bad Request)
    response.
