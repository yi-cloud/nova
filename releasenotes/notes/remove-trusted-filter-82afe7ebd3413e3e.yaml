    The *TrustedFilter* along with its related ``[trusted_computing]``
    configuration options were deprecated in the 16.0.0 Pike release and have
    been removed in the 17.0.0 Queens release. The *TrustedFilter* was always
    experimental, had no continuous integration testing to prove it still
    worked, and no reported users.
