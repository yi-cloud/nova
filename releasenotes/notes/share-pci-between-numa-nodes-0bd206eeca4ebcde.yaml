    Added support for PCI device NUMA affinity policies. These allow you to
    configure how strict your NUMA affinity should be on a per-device basis or,
    more specifically, per device alias. These are configured as part of the
    ``[pci]alias`` configuration option(s).

    There are three policies supported:

    - ``required`` (must-have)
    - ``legacy`` (must-have-if-available) (default)
    - ``preferred`` (nice-to-have)

    In all cases, strict NUMA affinity is provided if possible. The key
    difference between the policies is how much NUMA affinity one is willing to
    forsake before failing to schedule.
