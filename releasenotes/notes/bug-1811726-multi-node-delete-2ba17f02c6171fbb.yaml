    `Bug 1811726`_ is fixed by deleting the resource provider (in placement)
    associated with each compute node record managed by a ``nova-compute``
    service when that service is deleted via the
    ``DELETE /os-services/{service_id}`` API. This is particularly important
    for compute services managing ironic baremetal nodes.
