deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[libvirt]/sparse_logical_volumes`` configuration option is now
    deprecated. Sparse logical volumes were never verified by tests in Nova
    and some bugs were found without having fixes so we prefer to deprecate
    that feature.
    By default, the LVM image backend allocates all the disk size to a logical
    volume. If you want to have the volume group having thin-provisioned
    logical volumes, use Cinder with volume-backed instances.
