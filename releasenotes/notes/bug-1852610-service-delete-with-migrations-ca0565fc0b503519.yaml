    The ``DELETE /os-services/{service_id}`` compute API will now return a
    ``409 HTTPConflict`` response when trying to delete a ``nova-compute``
    service which is involved in in-progress migrations. This is because doing
    so would not only orphan the compute node resource provider in the
    placement service on which those instances have resource allocations but
    can also break the ability to confirm/revert a pending resize properly.
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1852610 for more details.
