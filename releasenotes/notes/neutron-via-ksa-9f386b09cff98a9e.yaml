    Nova now uses keystoneauth1 configuration to set up communication with the
    network service.  Use keystoneauth1 loading parameters for Adapter setup in
    the ``[neutron]`` conf section (auth and Session options continue to work
    as before).  Of note:

    * Legacy option ``url`` is deprecated and replaced by
      ``endpoint_override``.  This should not need to be specified if an
      appropriate service catalog entry exists for the network service.
    * When ``url`` is not used, ``region_name`` no longer defaults to
      ``RegionOne``.
    * In Queens, specifying ``url`` will trigger the legacy behavior.  The
      ``url`` option will be removed in Rocky.
