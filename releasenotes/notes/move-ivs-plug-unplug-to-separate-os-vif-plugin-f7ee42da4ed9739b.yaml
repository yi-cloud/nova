    This release moves the livirt driver ``IVS`` VIF plug-unplug to a separate
    package called ``os-vif-bigswitch``. This package is a requirement on
    compute nodes when using ``networking-bigswitch`` as neutron ML2 and L3
    driver.
    Releases are available on https://pypi.org/project/os-vif-bigswitch/. Major
    version for the package matches upstream neutron version number. Minor
    version tracks compatiblity with Big Cloud Fabric (BCF) releases, and
    typically is set to the lowest supported BCF release.
