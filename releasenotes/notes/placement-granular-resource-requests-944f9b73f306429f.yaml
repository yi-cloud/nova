    In version 1.25 of the Placement API, ``GET /allocation_candidates`` is
    enhanced to accept numbered groupings of resource, required/forbidden
    trait, and aggregate association requests. A ``resources`` query parameter
    key with a positive integer suffix (e.g. ``resources42``) will be logically
    associated with ``required`` and/or ``member_of`` query parameter keys with
    the same suffix (e.g. ``required42``, ``member_of42``). The resources,
    required/forbidden traits, and aggregate associations in that group will be
    satisfied by the same resource provider in the response. When more than one
    numbered grouping is supplied, the ``group_policy`` query parameter is
    required to indicate how the groups should interact. With
    ``group_policy=none``, separate groupings - numbered or unnumbered - may or
    may not be satisfied by the same provider. With ``group_policy=isolate``,
    numbered groups are guaranteed to be satisfied by *different* providers -
    though there may still be overlap with the unnumbered group.  In all cases,
    each ``allocation_request`` will be satisfied by providers in a single
    non-sharing provider tree and/or sharing providers associated via aggregate
    with any of the providers in that tree.

    The ``required`` and ``member_of`` query parameters for a given group are
    optional.  That is, you may specify ``resources42=XXX`` without a
    corresponding ``required42=YYY`` or ``member_of42=ZZZ``. However, the
    reverse (specifying ``required42=YYY`` or ``member_of42=ZZZ`` without
    ``resources42=XXX``) will result in an error.

    The semantic of the (unnumbered) ``resources``, ``required``, and
    ``member_of`` query parameters is unchanged: the resources, traits, and
    aggregate associations specified thereby may be satisfied by any provider
    in the same non-sharing tree or associated via the specified aggregate(s).
