    A new configuration option, ``[compute]/live_migration_wait_for_vif_plug``,
    has been added which can be used to configure compute services to wait
    for network interface plugging to complete on the destination host before
    starting the guest transfer on the source host during live migration.

    Note that this option is read on the destination host of a live migration.
    If you set this option the same on all of your compute hosts, which you
    should do if you use the same networking backend universally, you do not
    have to worry about this.

    This is disabled by default for backward compatibilty and because the
    compute service cannot reliably determine which types of virtual
    interfaces (``port.binding:vif_type``) will send ``network-vif-plugged``
    events without an accompanying port ``binding:host_id`` change.
    Open vSwitch and linuxbridge should be OK, but OpenDaylight is at least
    one known backend that will not currently work in this case, see bug
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/1755890 for more details.
