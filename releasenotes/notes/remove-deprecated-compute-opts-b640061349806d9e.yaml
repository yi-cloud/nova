upgrade:
  - |
    The following deprecated configuration options have been removed from the
    ``compute`` section of ``nova.conf``:

    - ``multi_instance_display_name_template``

    These were deprecated in the 15.0.0 release as they allowed for
    inconsistent API behavior across deployments.
