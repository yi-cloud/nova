deprecations:
  - |
    The following configuration options are deprecated for removal:

    - ``[DEFAULT]/monkey_patch``
    - ``[DEFAULT]/monkey_patch_modules``

    Monkey patching nova is not tested, not supported, and is a barrier to
    interoperability. If you have code which relies on monkey patching
    decorators, for example, for notifications, please propose those changes
    upstream.

    As a result, the following option is also deprecated for removal since it
    is only used when specified with ``[DEFAULT]/monkey_patch_modules``:

    - ``[notifications]/default_publisher_id``
