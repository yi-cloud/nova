upgrade:
  - |
    The ``[filter_scheduler]/use_baremetal_filters`` and
    ``[filter_scheduler]/baremetal_enabled_filters`` configuration options
    were deprecated in the 16.0.0 Pike release since deployments serving
    baremetal instances should be `scheduling based on resource classes`_.
    Those options have now been removed.

    Similarly, the ``ironic_host_manager`` choice for the
    ``[scheduler]/host_manager`` configuration option was deprecated in the
    17.0.0 Queens release because ``ironic_host_manager`` is only useful when
    using ``use_baremetal_filters=True`` and ``baremetal_enabled_filters``.
    Now that those options are gone, the deprecated ``ironic_host_manager``
    host manager choice has also been removed. As a result, the
    ``[scheduler]/host_manager`` configuration option has also been removed
    since there is only one host manager now and no need for an option.

    Remember to run ``nova-status upgrade check`` before upgrading to
    18.0.0 Rocky to ensure baremetal instances have had their embedded
    flavor migrated to use the corresponding ironic node custom resource class.
