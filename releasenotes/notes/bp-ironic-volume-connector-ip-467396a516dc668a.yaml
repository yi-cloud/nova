    When creating a baremetal instance with volumes, the ironic driver will
    now pass an IP address of an iSCSI initiator to the block storage service
    because the volume backend may require the IP address for access control.
    If an IP address is set to an ironic node as a volume connector resource,
    the address is used. If a node has MAC addresses as volume connector
    resources, an IP address is retrieved from VIFs associated with the MAC
    addresses. IPv4 addresses are given priority over IPv6 addresses if both
    are available.
