upgrade:
  - |
    The following deprecated options have been removed from the ``placement``
    group of ``nova.conf``:

    - ``os_region_name`` (use ``region_name`` instead)
    - ``os_interface`` (use ``valid_interfaces`` instead)

    These were deprecated in 17.0.0 as they have been superseded by their
    respective keystoneauth1 Adapter configuration options.
