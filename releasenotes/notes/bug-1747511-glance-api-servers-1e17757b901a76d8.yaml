    Due to a bug in python-glanceclient:

    https://bugs.launchpad.net/python-glanceclient/+bug/1707995

    If ``[glance]/api_servers`` is not set in nova.conf, and there is a
    versioned endpoint URL in the service catalog, nova makes a best attempt
    at parsing and stripping the version from the URL in order to make
    API requests to the image service.
