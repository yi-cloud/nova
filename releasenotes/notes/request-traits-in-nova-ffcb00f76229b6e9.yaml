    Added traits support to the scheduler. A new flavor extra spec is added to
    support specifying the required traits. The syntax of extra spec is
    ``trait:<trait_name>=required``, for example:

    - trait:HW_CPU_X86_AVX2=required
    - trait:STORAGE_DISK_SSD=required

    The scheduler will pass required traits to the
    ``GET /allocation_candidates`` endpoint in the Placement API to include
    only resource providers that can satisfy the required traits. Currently
    the only valid value is ``required``. Any other value will be considered
    invalid.

    This requires that the Placement API version 1.17 is available before
    the ``nova-scheduler`` service can use this feature.

    The FilterScheduler is currently the only scheduler driver that supports
    this feature.
