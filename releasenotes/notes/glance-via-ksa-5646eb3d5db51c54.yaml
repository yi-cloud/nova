    Nova now uses keystoneauth1 configuration to set up communication with the
    image service.  Use keystoneauth1 loading parameters for Session and
    Adapter setup in the ``[glance]`` conf section.  This includes using
    ``endpoint_override`` in favor of ``api_servers``.  The
    ``[glance]api_servers`` conf option is still supported, but should only be
    used if you need multiple endpoints and are unable to use a load balancer
    for some reason.  However, note that no configuration is necessary with an
    appropriate service catalog entry for the image service.
