upgrade:

    The ``nova-consoleauth`` service is deprecated and should no longer be
    deployed, however, if there is a requirement to maintain support for
    existing console sessions through a live/rolling upgrade, operators should
    set ``[workarounds]enable_consoleauth = True`` in their configuration and
    continue running ``nova-consoleauth`` for the duration of the live/rolling
    upgrade.
    A new check has been added to the ``nova-status upgrade check`` CLI to
    help with this and it will emit a warning and provide additional
    instructions to set ``[workarounds]enable_consoleauth = True`` while
    performing a live/rolling upgrade.
