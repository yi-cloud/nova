deprecations:
  - |
    Two keymap-related configuration options have been deprecated:

    - ``[vnc] keymap``
    - ``[spice] keymap``

    The VNC option affects the libvirt and VMWare virt drivers, while the SPICE
    option only affects libvirt. For the libvirt driver, configuring these
    options resulted in lossy keymap conversions for the given graphics method.
    It is recommended that users should unset these options and configure their
    guests as necessary instead. In the case of noVNC, noVNC 1.0.0 should be
    used as this provides support for QEMU's Extended Key Event messages. Refer
    to `bug #1682020`__ and the `QEMU RFB pull request`__ for more information.

    For the VMWare driver, only the VNC option applies. However, this option is
    deprecated and will not affect any other driver in the future. A new option
    has been added to the ``[vmware]`` group to replace this:

    - ``[vmware] vnc_keymap``

    The ``[vnc] keymap`` and ``[spice] keymap`` options will be removed in a
    future release.

upgrade:
  - |
    noVNC 1.0.0 introduced a breaking change in the URLs used to access the
    console. Previously, the ``vnc_auto.html`` path was used but it is now
    necessary to use the ``vnc_lite.html`` path. When noVNC is updated to
    1.0.0, ``[vnc] novncproxy_base_url`` configuration value must be updated on
    each compute node to reflect this change.
