    Exposes flavor extra_specs in the flavor representation since microversion
    2.61. Flavor extra_specs will be included in Response body of the
    following APIs:

    * ``GET /flavors/detail``
    * ``GET /flavors/{flavor_id}``
    * ``POST /flavors``
    * ``PUT /flavors/{flavor_id}``

    Now users can see the flavor extra-specs in flavor APIs response and do
    not need to call ``GET /flavors/{flavor_id}/os-extra_specs`` API. The
    visibility of the flavor extra_specs within the flavor resource will be
    controlled by the same policy rules as are used for showing the flavor
    extra_specs. If the user has no access to query extra_specs, the
    ``flavor.extra_specs`` will not be included.
