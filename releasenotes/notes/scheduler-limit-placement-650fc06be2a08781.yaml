    The FilterScheduler now limits the number of results in the query it makes
    to placement to avoid situations where every compute node in a large
    deployment is returned. This is configurable with the new
    ``[scheduler]/max_placement_results`` configuration option, which defaults
    to 1000, a sane starting value for any size deployment.
