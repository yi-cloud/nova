    A new ``[workarounds]/report_ironic_standard_resource_class_inventory``
    configuration option has been added.

    Starting in the 16.0.0 Pike release, ironic nodes can be scheduled using
    custom resource classes rather than the standard resource classes VCPU,
    MEMORY_MB and DISK_GB:

    https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/rocky/install/configure-nova-flavors.html

    However, existing ironic instances require a data migration which can be
    achieved either by restarting ``nova-compute`` services managing ironic
    nodes or running ``nova-manage db ironic_flavor_migration``. The completion
    of the data migration can be checked by running the
    ``nova-status upgrade check`` command and checking the
    "Ironic Flavor Migration" result.

    Once all data migrations are complete, you can set this option to False to
    stop reporting VCPU, MEMORY_MB and DISK_GB resource class inventory to the
    Placement service so that scheduling will only rely on the custom resource
    class for each ironic node, as described in the document above.

    Note that this option does not apply starting in the 19.0.0 Stein release
    since the ironic compute driver no longer reports standard resource class
    inventory regardless of configuration.

    Alternatives to this workaround would be unsetting ``memory_mb`` and/or
    ``vcpus`` properties from ironic nodes, or using host aggregates to
    segregate VM from BM compute hosts and restrict flavors to those
    aggregates, but those alternatives might not be feasible at large scale.

    details.
