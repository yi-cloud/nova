    Listing server and migration records used to give a 500 to users
    when a cell database was unreachable. Now only records from available
    cells are included to avoid the 500 error. The down cells are basically
    skipped when forming the results and this solution is planned to be
    further enhanced through the `blueprint handling-down-cell`_.
