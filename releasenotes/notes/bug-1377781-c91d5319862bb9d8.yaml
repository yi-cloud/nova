    Add support for graceful shutdown of VMware instances. The timeout parameter of the power_off
    method is now considered by the VMware driver. If you specify a timeout greater than 0, the
    driver calls the appropriate soft shutdown method of the VMware API and only forces a hard
    shutdown if the soft shutdown did not succeed before the timeout is reached.
