    When forcing a specified destination host during evacuate, the
    scheduler is bypassed but resource allocations will still be made in the
    Placement service against the forced destination host. If the resource
    allocation against the destination host fails, the evacuate operation
    will fail, regardless of the ``force`` flag being specified in the API.
    The guest will be unchanged on the source host. For more details, see
    `bug 1713786`_.
