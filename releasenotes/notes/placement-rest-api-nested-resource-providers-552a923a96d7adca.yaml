  - New placement REST API microversion 1.14 is added to support nested
    resource providers. Users of the placement REST API can now pass a
    ``in_tree=<UUID>`` parameter to the ``GET /resource_providers`` REST API
    call.  This will trigger the placement service to return all resource
    provider records within the "provider tree" of the resource provider with
    the supplied UUID value. The resource provider representation now includes
    a ``parent_provider_uuid`` value that indicates the UUID of the immediate
    parent resource provider, or ``null`` if the provider has no parent. For
    convenience, the resource provider resource also contains a
    ``root_provider_uuid`` field that is populated with the UUID of the
    top-most resource provider in the provider tree.
