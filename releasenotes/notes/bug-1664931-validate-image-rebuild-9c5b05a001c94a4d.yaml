    `OSSA-2017-005`_: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action

    By rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to circumvent
    the FilterScheduler bypassing imposed filters (for example, the
    ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All setups using the
    FilterScheduler (or CachingScheduler) are affected.

    The fix is in the `nova-api` and `nova-conductor` services.
