    The payload of the ``instance.snapshot.start`` and
    ``instance.snapshot.end`` notifications have been extended with the
    ``snapshot_image_id`` field that contains the image id of the snapshot
    created. This change also causes that the type of the payload object has
    been changed from ``InstanceActionPayload`` version 1.5 to
    ``InstanceActionSnapshotPayload`` version 1.6. See the
    `notification dev reference`_ for the sample file of
    ``instance.snapshot.start`` as an example.
