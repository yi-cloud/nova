    In microversion 1.23 of the placement service, JSON formatted error
    responses gain a new attribute, ``code``, with a value that identifies the
    type of this error. This can be used to distinguish errors that are
    different but use the same HTTP status code. Any error response which does
    not specifically define a code will have the code
    ``placement.undefined_code``.
