    Added a new flavor extra_spec, ``hide_hypervisor_id``, which hides
    the hypervisor signature for the guest when true ('kvm' won't appear
    in ``lscpu``). This acts exactly like and in parallel to the image
    property ``img_hide_hypervisor_id`` and is useful for running the
    nvidia drivers in the guest.
    Currently, this is only supported in the libvirt driver.
