    A ``nova-manage placement sync_aggregates`` command has been added which
    can be used to mirror nova host aggregates to resource provider aggregates
    in the placement service. This is a useful tool if you are using aggregates
    in placement to optimize scheduling:

    https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/configuration/schedulers.html#aggregates-in-placement

    The ``os-aggregates`` compute API ``add_host`` and ``remove_host`` actions
    will automatically add/remove compute node resource providers from resource
    provider aggregates in the placement service if the ``nova-api`` service
    is configured to communicate with the placement service, so this command
    is mostly useful for existing deployments with host aggregates which are
    not yet mirrored in the placement service.

    For more details, see the command documentation:
