    It is now possible to configure granular policy rules for placement
    REST API operations.

    By default, all operations continue to use the ``role:admin`` check string
    so there is no upgrade impact.

    A new configuration option is introduced, ``[placement]/policy_file``,
    which is used to configure the location of the placement policy file.
    By default, the ``placement-policy.yaml`` file may live alongside the
    nova policy file, e.g.:

    * /etc/nova/policy.yaml
    * /etc/nova/placement-policy.yaml

    However, if desired, ``[placement]/policy_file`` makes it possible to
    package and deploy the placement policy file separately to make the future
    split of placement and nova packages easier, e.g.:

    * /etc/placement/policy.yaml

    All placement policy rules are defined in code so by default no extra
    configuration is required and the default rules will be used on start of
    the placement service.

    For more information about placement policy including a sample file, see
    the configuration reference documentation:
