    The new style ``policy`` field has been added to ``ServerGroupPayload``.
    The ``server_group.create``, ``server_group.delete`` and
    ``server_group.add_member`` versioned notifications will be updated to
    include the new ``policy`` and ``rules`` field. The ``policies`` field is
    deprecated for removal but still put into the notification payload for
    backward compatibility.
