features:
  - |
    The PowerVM virt driver now supports booting from local ephemeral disk.
    Two new configuration options have been introduced to the ``powervm``
    configuration group, ``disk_driver`` and ``volume_group_name``. The former
    allows the selection of either ssp or localdisk for the PowerVM disk
    driver. The latter specifies the name of the volume group when using the
    localdisk disk driver.
upgrade:
  - |
    The PowerVM virt driver previously used the PowerVM Shared Storage Pool
    disk driver by default. The default disk driver for PowerVM is now
    localdisk. See configuration option ``[powervm]/disk_driver`` for usage
    details.
