    Currently the ``nova-manage cell_v2 map_instances`` command uses a marker
    setup by which repeated runs of the command will start from where the last
    run finished, by default. A ``--reset`` option has been added to this command
    by which the marker can be reset and users can start the process from the
    beginning if needed, instead of the default behavior.
