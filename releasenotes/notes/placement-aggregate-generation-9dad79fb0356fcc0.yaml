    Placement API microversion 1.19 enhances the payloads for the
    `GET /resource_providers/{uuid}/aggregates` response and the
    `PUT /resource_providers/{uuid}/aggregates` request and response to be
    identical, and to include the ``resource_provider_generation``. As with
    other generation-aware APIs, if the ``resource_provider_generation``
    specified in the `PUT` request does not match the generation known by the
    server, a 409 Conflict error is returned.
