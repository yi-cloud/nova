upgrade:
  - |
    The ``notify_on_api_faults`` config option and the ``api.fault``
    notification it enabled have been removed. As noted in `bug 1699115`_,
    the ``api.fault`` notification has not worked since the v2.1 API was
    introduced. As the v2.0 API is supported with the v2.1 codebase since
    Newton, this notification has not been emitted since Newton. Given that
    no one has reported an issue with this in that time, it is simply
    removed.
