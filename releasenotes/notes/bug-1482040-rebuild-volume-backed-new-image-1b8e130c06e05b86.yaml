    A fix is made for `bug 1482040`_ where a request to rebuild a volume-backed
    server with a new image which is different than what is in the root volume
    will now fail with a `400 Bad Request` response. The compute API would
    previously return a `202 Accepted` response but the backend compute service
    does not replace the image in the root disk so the API behavior was always
    wrong and is now explicit about the failure.
