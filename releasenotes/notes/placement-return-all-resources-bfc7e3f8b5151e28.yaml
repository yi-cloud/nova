    From microversion 1.27, the ``provider_summaries`` field in the
    response of the ``GET /allocation_candidates`` API includes all
    the resource class inventories, while it had only requested
    resource class inventories with older microversions.
    Now callers can use this additional inventory information in
    making further sorting or filtering decisions.
