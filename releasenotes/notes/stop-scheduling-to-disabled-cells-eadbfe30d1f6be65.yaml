    Support for filtering out disabled cells during scheduling for server
    create requests has been added. Firstly the concept of disabled
    cells has been introduced which means such disabled cells will not be
    candidates for the scheduler. Secondly changes have been made to the filter
    scheduler to ensure that it chooses only the enabled cells for scheduling
    and filters out the disabled ones. Note that operations on existing
    instances already inside a disabled cell like move operations will not be
    blocked.

    If the scheduler service is started before the cell mappings are created or
    setup, nova-scheduler needs to be restarted or SIGHUP-ed for the newly
    added cells to get registered in the scheduler cache.
