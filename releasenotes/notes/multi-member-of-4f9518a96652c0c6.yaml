    A new 1.24 placement API microversion adds the ability to specify multiple
    `member_of` query parameters for the `GET /resource_providers` and `GET
    allocation_candidates` endpoints.
    When multiple `member_of` query parameters are received, the placement
    service will return resource providers that match all of the requested
    aggregate memberships. The `member_of=in:<agg uuids>` format is still
    supported and continues to indicate an IN() operation for aggregate
    membership. Some examples for using the new functionality:
    Get all providers that are associated with BOTH agg1 and agg2:
    ?member_of=agg1&member_of=agg2
    Get all providers that are associated with agg1 OR agg2:
    ?member_of=in:agg1,agg2
    Get all providers that are associated with agg1 and ANY OF (agg2, agg3):
    ?member_of=agg1&member_of=in:agg2,agg3
    Get all providers that are associated with ANY OF (agg1, agg2) AND are also
    associated with ANY OF (agg3, agg4):
    ?member_of=in:agg1,agg2&member_of=in:agg3,agg4
