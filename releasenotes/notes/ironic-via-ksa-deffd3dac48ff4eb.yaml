upgrade:
  - |
    Nova now uses keystoneauth1 configuration to set up communication with the
    baremetal service.  Use keystoneauth1 loading parameters for auth, Session,
    and Adapter setup in the ``[ironic]`` conf section.  This includes using
    ``endpoint_override`` in favor of ``api_endpoint``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``[ironic]api_endpoint`` is deprecated in favor of
    ``[ironic]endpoint_override``.
