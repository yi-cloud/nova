upgrade:
  - |
    The following deprecated configuration options have been removed from the
    ``api`` section of ``nova.conf``:

    - ``allow_instance_snapshots``

    These were deprecated in the 16.0.0 release as they allowed inconsistent
    API behavior across deployments. To disable snapshots in the
    ``createImage`` server action API, change the
    ``os_compute_api:servers:create_image`` and
    ``os_compute_api:servers:create_image:allow_volume_backed`` policies.
