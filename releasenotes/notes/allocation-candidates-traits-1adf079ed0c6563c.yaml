    Add ``required`` query parameter to the ``GET /allocation_candidates`` API
    in new placement microversion 1.17. The parameter accepts a list of traits
    separated by ``,``, which is used to further limit the list of allocation
    requests to resource providers that have the capacity to fulfill the
    requested resources AND *collectively* have all of the required traits
    associated with them. In the same microversion, the provider summary
    includes the traits associated with each provider.
