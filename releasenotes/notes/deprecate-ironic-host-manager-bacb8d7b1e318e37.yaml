deprecations:
  - |
    The `IronicHostManager` is now deprecated along with the
    ``[scheduler]/host_manager`` option of ``ironic_host_manager``.

    As of the 16.0.0 Pike release, the ``ExactRamFilter``, ``ExactCoreFilter``,
    and ``ExactDiskFilter`` scheduler filters are all deprecated along with
    the ``[scheduler]/use_baremetal_filters`` and
    ``[scheduler]/baremental_enabled_filters`` options. Deployments should
    migrate to using resource classes with baremetal flavors as described in
    the ironic install guide:
