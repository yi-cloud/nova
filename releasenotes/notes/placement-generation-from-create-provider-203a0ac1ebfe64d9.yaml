    In placement API microversion 1.20, a successful `POST /resource_providers`
    returns 200 with a payload representing the newly-created resource
    provider.  The format is the same format as the result of the corresponding
    ``GET /resource_providers/{uuid}`` call. This is to allow the caller to
    glean automatically-set fields, such as UUID and generation, without a
    subsequent GET.
