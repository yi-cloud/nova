    [`bug 1818295 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1818295>`_]
    Fixes the problem with endpoint lookup in Ironic driver where only public
    endpoint is possible, which breaks deployments where the controllers have
    no route to the public network per security requirement. Note that
    python-ironicclient fix I610836e5038774621690aca88b2aee25670f0262 must
    also be present to resolve the bug.
