    An optional configuration group ``placement_database`` can be used in
    nova.conf to configure a separate database for use with the placement
    API.

    If ``placement_database.connection`` has a value then the
    ``placement_database`` configuration group will be used to configure a
    separate placement database, including using ``connection`` to identify the
    target database. That database will have a schema that is a replica of all
    the tables used in the API database. The new database schema will be
    created and synchronized when the ``nova-manage api_db sync`` command is
    run.

    When the ``placement_database.connection`` setting is omitted the existing
    settings for the ``api_database`` will be used for hosting placement data.

    Setting ``placement_database.connection`` and calling
    ``nova-manage api_db sync`` will only create tables. No data will be
    migrated. In an existing OpenStack deployment, if there is existing
    placement data in the ``nova_api`` database this will not be copied. It is
    up to the deployment to manually replicate that data in a fashion that
    works best for the environment.
