    Nova now defaults to using the live snapshot feature of libvirt
    when taking snapshots. This was previously disabled by default due
    to crashes on load seen with older libvirt versions. It has been
    used in production by many clouds, and appears stable in real
    world environments. If you see crashes of guests during snapshots,
    you can disable this with the ``disable_libvirt_livesnapshot``
    config value in ``[workarounds]``.
