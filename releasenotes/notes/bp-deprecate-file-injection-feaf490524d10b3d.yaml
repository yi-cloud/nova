    The 2.57 microversion makes the following changes:

    * The ``user_data`` parameter is added to the server rebuild API.
    * The ``personality`` parameter is removed from the server create and
      rebuild APIs. Use the ``user_data`` parameter instead.
    * The ``maxPersonality`` and ``maxPersonalitySize`` limits are excluded
      from the ``GET /limits`` API response.
    * The ``injected_files``, ``injected_file_content_bytes`` and
      ``injected_file_path_bytes`` quotas are removed from the
      ``os-quota-sets`` and ``os-quota-class-sets`` APIs.

    See the `spec`_ for more details and reasoning.
