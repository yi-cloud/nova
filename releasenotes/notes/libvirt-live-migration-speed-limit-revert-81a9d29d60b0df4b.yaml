    Note that the original fix for `bug 1414559`_ committed early in rocky was automatic and always
    enabled. Because of `bug 1786346`_ that fix has since been reverted and superseded by an opt-in
    mechanism which must be enabled. Setting ``[compute]/live_migration_wait_for_vif_plug=True``
    will restore the behavior of `waiting for neutron events`_ during the live migration process.
