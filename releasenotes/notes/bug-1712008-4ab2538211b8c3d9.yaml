    The ``nova-conductor`` service now needs access to the Placement service
    in the case of forcing a destination host during a live migration. Ensure
    the ``[placement]`` section of nova.conf for the ``nova-conductor`` service
    is filled in.
fixes:
  - |
    When forcing a specified destination host during live migration, the
    scheduler is bypassed but resource allocations will still be made in the
    Placement service against the forced destination host. If the resource
    allocation against the destination host fails, the live migration operation
    will fail, regardless of the ``force`` flag being specified in the API.
    The guest will be unchanged on the source host. For more details, see
    `bug 1712008`_.
