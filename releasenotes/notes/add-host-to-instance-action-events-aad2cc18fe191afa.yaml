    The microversion 2.62 adds ``host`` (hostname) and ``hostId`` (an
    obfuscated hashed host id string) fields to the instance action
    ``GET /servers/{server_id}/os-instance-actions/{req_id}`` API. The display
    of the newly added ``host`` field will be controlled via policy rule
    ``os_compute_api:os-instance-actions:events``, which is the same policy
    used for the ``events.traceback`` field. If the user is prevented by
    policy, only ``hostId`` will be displayed.
