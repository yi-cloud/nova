    XenServer Pools with shared storage used to use aggregates in Nova,
    however this support was not adequately tested and became broken in
    a previous release.
    Now live migration with shared storage is possible using native
    XAPI pools - independently of Nova's aggregates.
    The XenAPI/Nova integration expects one nova-compute per XenServer
    host, so a nova-compute must be run for each slave XenServer host
    in the pool as well as for the master.
