    A new policy rule, ``os_compute_api:servers:create:zero_disk_flavor``, has
    been introduced which defaults to ``rule:admin_or_owner`` for backward
    compatibility, but can be configured to make the compute
    API enforce that server create requests using a flavor with zero root disk
    must be volume-backed or fail with a ``403 HTTPForbidden`` error.

    Allowing image-backed servers with a zero root disk flavor can be
    potentially hazardous if users are allowed to upload their own images,
    since an instance created with a zero root disk flavor gets its size
    from the image, which can be unexpectedly large and exhaust local disk
    on the compute host. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1739646 for
    more details.

    While this is introduced in a backward-compatible way, the default will
    be changed to ``rule:admin_api`` in a subsequent release. It is advised
    that you communicate this change to your users before turning on
    enforcement since it will result in a compute API behavior change.
