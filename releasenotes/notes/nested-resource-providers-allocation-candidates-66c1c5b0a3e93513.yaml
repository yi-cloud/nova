    From microversion 1.29, we support allocation candidates with nested
    resource providers. Namely, the following features are added.
    1) ``GET /allocation_candidates`` is aware of nested providers. Namely,
    when provider trees are present, ``allocation_requests`` in the response
    of ``GET /allocation_candidates`` can include allocations on combinations
    of multiple resource providers in the same tree.
    2) ``root_provider_uuid`` and ``parent_provider_uuid`` are added to
    ``provider_summaries`` in the response of ``GET /allocation_candidates``.
