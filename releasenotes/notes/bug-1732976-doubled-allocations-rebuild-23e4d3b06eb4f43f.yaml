    `OSSA-2017-006`_: Nova FilterScheduler doubles resource allocations during
    rebuild with new image (CVE-2017-17051)

    By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated user
    may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of
    service. This regression was introduced with the fix for `OSSA-2017-005`_
    (CVE-2017-16239), however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments with
    that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.

    The fix is in the `nova-api` and `nova-scheduler` services.

    .. note:: The fix for errata in `OSSA-2017-005`_ (CVE-2017-16239) will
              need to be applied in addition to this fix.
