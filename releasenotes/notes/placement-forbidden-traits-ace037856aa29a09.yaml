    Placement microversion '1.22' adds support for expressing traits which are
    forbidden when filtering ``GET /resource_providers`` or ``GET
    /allocation_candidates``. A forbidden trait is a properly formatted trait
    in the existing ``required`` parameter, prefixed by a ``!``. For example
    ``required=!STORAGE_DISK_SSD`` asks that the results not include any
    resource providers that provide solid state disk.
