    The default list of non-inherited image properties to pop when creating a
    snapshot has been extended to include image signature properties. The
    properties ``img_signature_hash_method``, ``img_signature``,
    ``img_signature_key_type`` and ``img_signature_certificate_uuid`` are no
    longer inherited by the snapshot image as they would otherwise result in
    a Glance attempting to verify the snapshot image with the signature of the
    original.
