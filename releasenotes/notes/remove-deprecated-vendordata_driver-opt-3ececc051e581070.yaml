upgrade:
  - |
    The ``[DEFAULT] vendordata_driver`` option was deprecated in Mitaka and has
    now been removed. Configuration of vendordata drivers should now be done by
    using the ``[api] vendordata_providers`` option. For more information,
    refer to the `vendordata documentation`__.

    __ https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/vendordata.html
  - |
    The ``[api] vendordata_providers`` option now defaults to ``[StaticJSON]``.
    This ensures existing behavior of the vendordata v1 driver is preserved.
