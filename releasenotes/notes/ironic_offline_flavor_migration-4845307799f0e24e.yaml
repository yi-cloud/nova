    The ironic driver will automatically migrate instance flavors for resource classes
    at runtime. If you are not able to run the compute and ironic services at pike because
    you are automating an upgrade past this release, you can use the
    ``nova-manage db ironic_flavor_migration`` to push the migration manually. This is only
    for advanced users taking on the risk of automating the process of upgrading through
    pike and is not recommended for normal users.
