    The minimum required version of libvirt used by the `nova-compute`
    service is now 1.3.1.  And the minimum required version of QEMU used
    by the `nova-compute` service is now 2.5.0. Failing to meet these
    minimum versions when using the libvirt compute driver will result
    in the `nova-compute` service not starting.
