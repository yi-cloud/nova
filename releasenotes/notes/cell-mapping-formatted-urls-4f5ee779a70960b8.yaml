    The URLs in cell mapping records may now include variables that are filled
    from the corresponding default URL specified in the host's configuration
    file. This allows per-host credentials, as well as other values to be set
    in the config file which will affect the URL of a cell, as calculated when
    loading the record. For ``database_connection``, the ``[database]/connection``
    URL is used as the base. For ``transport_url``, the ``[DEFAULT]/transport_url``
    is used. For more information, see the cells configuration docs:
