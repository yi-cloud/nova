deprecations:
  - |
    The ``nova-consoleauth`` service has been deprecated. Console token
    authorization storage is moving from the ``nova-consoleauth`` service
    backend to the database backend, with storage happening in both, in Rocky.
    In Stein, only the database backend will be used for console token
    authorization storage.

    .. note:: Cells v1 was not converted to use the database backend for
      console token authorizations. Cells v1 console token authorizations will
      continue to be supported by the ``nova-consoleauth`` service.
