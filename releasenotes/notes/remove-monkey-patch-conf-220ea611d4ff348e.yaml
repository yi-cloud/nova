upgrade:
  - |
    The following configuration options were deprecated for removal in the
    17.0.0 Queens release and have now been removed:

    - ``[DEFAULT]/monkey_patch``
    - ``[DEFAULT]/monkey_patch_modules``
    - ``[notifications]/default_publisher_id``

    Monkey patching nova is not tested, not supported, and is a barrier to
    interoperability. If you have code which relies on monkey patching
    decorators, for example, for notifications, please propose those changes
    upstream.
