    This release includes a fix for `bug 1733886`_ which was a regression
    introduced in the 2.36 API microversion where the ``force`` parameter was
    missing from the ``PUT /os-quota-sets/{tenant_id}`` API request schema so
    users could not force quota updates with microversion 2.36 or later. The
    bug is now fixed so that the ``force`` parameter can once again be
    specified during quota updates. There is no new microversion for this
    change since it is an admin-only API.
