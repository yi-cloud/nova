upgrade:
  - |
    Nova now uses keystoneauth1 configuration to set up communication with the
    placement service.  Use keystoneauth1 loading parameters for auth, Session,
    and Adapter setup in the ``[placement]`` conf section.  Note that, by
    default, the 'internal' interface will be tried first, followed by the
    'public' interface.  Use the conf option ``[placement].valid_interfaces``
    to override this behavior.
deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration options in the ``[placement]`` section are deprecated as
    follows:

    * ``os_region_name`` is deprecated in favor of ``region_name``
    * ``os_interface`` is deprecated in favor of ``valid_interfaces``
