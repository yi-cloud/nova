    When testing whether direct IO is possible on the backing storage
    for an instance, Nova now uses a block size of 4096 bytes instead
    of 512 bytes, avoiding issues when the underlying block device has
    sectors larger than 512 bytes. See bug
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/1801702 for details.
