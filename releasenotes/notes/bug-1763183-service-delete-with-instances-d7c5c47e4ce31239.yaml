    The ``DELETE /os-services/{service_id}`` compute API will now return a
    ``409 HTTPConflict`` response when trying to delete a ``nova-compute``
    service which is still hosting instances. This is because doing so would
    orphan the compute node resource provider in the placement service on
    which those instances have resource allocations, which affects scheduling.
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1763183 for more details.
