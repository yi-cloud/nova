    The ``TypeAffinityFilter``, which was deprecated in the 16.0.0 Pike
    release, has been removed. The filter was flawed in that it relied on the
    flavor ``id`` primary key which cannot be relied upon since you cannot
    "edit" a flavor to change its disk, vcpu, etc values. Therefore to change
    a given flavor, it must be deleted and re-created, which means a new ``id``
    value, thus potentially breaking the usefulness of the filter. Also, the
    flavor migration from the ``nova`` database to the ``nova_api`` database
    would also have resulted in different ``id`` values.
