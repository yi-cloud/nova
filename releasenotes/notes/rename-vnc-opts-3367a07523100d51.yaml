    The following configuration options have been renamed:

    - ``[vnc]vncserver_listen`` (now ``[vnc]server_listen``)
    - ``[vnc]vncserver_proxyclient_address`` (now
      ``[vnc]server_proxyclient_address``)

    This establishes a consistent naming between VNC and Spice options and
    removes some unnecessary duplication.
