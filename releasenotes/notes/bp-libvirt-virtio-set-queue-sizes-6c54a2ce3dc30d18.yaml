    libvirt: add support for virtio-net rx/tx queue sizes

    Add support for configuring the ``rx_queue_size`` and
    ``tx_queue_size`` options in the QEMU virtio-net driver by way of
    nova.conf. Only supported for vhost/vhostuser interfaces

    Currently, valid values for the ring buffer sizes are 256, 512,
    and 1024.

    Adjustable RX queue sizes requires QEMU 2.7.0, and libvirt 2.3.0
    (or newer) Adjustable TX queue sizes requires QEMU 2.10.0, and
    libvirt 3.7.0 (or newer)
