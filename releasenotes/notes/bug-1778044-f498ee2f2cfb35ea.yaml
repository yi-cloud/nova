    The initial implementation of native LUKS decryption within Libvirt 2.2.0
    had a `known issue`_ with the use of passphrases that were a multiple of 16
    bytes in size. This was `resolved`_ in the upstream 3.3.0 release of
    Libvirt and has been backported to various downstream distribution specific
    versions.

    A simple warning will reference the above if this issue is encountered by
    Nova however operators of the environment will still need to update
    Libvirt to a version where this issue has been fixed to resolve the issue.
