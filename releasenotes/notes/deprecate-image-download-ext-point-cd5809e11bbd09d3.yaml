deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[glance]/allowed_direct_url_schemes`` configuration option and
    ``nova.image.download.modules`` extension point have been deprecated for
    removal. These were originally added for the *nova.image.download.file*
    FileTransfer extension which was removed in the 16.0.0 Pike release. The
    ``nova.image.download.modules`` extension point is not maintained
    and there is no indication of its use in production clouds. If you are
    using this extension point, please make the nova development team
    aware by contacting us in the #openstack-nova freenode IRC channel or
    on the openstack-dev mailing list.
