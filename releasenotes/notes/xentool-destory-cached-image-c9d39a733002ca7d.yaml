    For the XenAPI driver, in order to delete cached images based on when they
    were created, a new ``--keep-days DAYS`` option is added to the
    ``destroy_cached_images`` script to delete cached images which were created
    at least ``DAYS`` days ago. By default, all unused cached images will be
    deleted when the script is run if they have ``cached_time``.
