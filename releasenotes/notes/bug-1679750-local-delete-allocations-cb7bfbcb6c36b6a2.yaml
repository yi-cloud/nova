    The ``nova-api`` service now requires the ``[placement]`` section to be
    configured in nova.conf if you are using a separate config file just for
    that service. This is because the ``nova-api`` service now needs to talk
    to the placement service in order to delete resource provider allocations
    when deleting an instance and the ``nova-compute`` service on which that
    instance is running is down. This change is idempotent if
    ``[placement]`` is not configured in ``nova-api`` but it will result in
    new warnings in the logs until configured. See bug
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1679750 for more details.
