    `Bug 1675791`_ has been fixed by granting image membership access to
    snapshot images when the owner of the server is not performing the
    snapshot/backup/shelve operation on the server. For example, an admin
    shelves a user's server and the user needs to unshelve the server so the
    user needs access to the shelved snapshot image.

    Note that only the image owner may delete the image, so in the case of
    a shelved offloaded server, if the user unshelves or deletes the server,
    that operation will work but there will be a warning in the logs because
    the shelved snapshot image could not be deleted since the user does not
    own the image. Similarly, if an admin creates a snapshot of a server in
    another project, the admin owns the snapshot image and the non-admin
    project, while having shared image member access to see the image, cannot
    delete the snapshot.

    The bug fix applies to both the ``nova-osapi_compute`` and ``nova-compute``
    service so older compute services will need to be patched.
