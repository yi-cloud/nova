    It is now possible to configure NUMA affinity for most neutron networks.
    This is available for networks that use a ``provider:network_type`` of
    ``flat`` or ``vlan`` and a ``provider:physical_network`` (L2 networks) or
    networks that use a ``provider:network_type`` of ``vxlan``, ``gre`` or
    ``geneve`` (L3 networks).

    For more information, refer to the `spec`__ and `documentation`__.
