    Booting volume-backed instances no longer includes an incorrect allocation
    against the compute node for the root disk. Historically, this has been
    quite broken behavior in Nova, where volume-backed instances would count
    against available space on the compute node, even though their storage
    was provided by the volume service. Now, newly-booted volume-backed
    instances will not create allocations of ``DISK_GB`` against the compute
    node for the ``root_gb`` quantity in the flavor. Note that if you are
    still using a scheduler configured with the (now deprecated)
    DiskFilter (including deployments using CachingScheduler), the
    above change will not apply to you.
