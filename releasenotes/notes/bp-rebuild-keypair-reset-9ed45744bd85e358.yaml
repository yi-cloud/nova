    A new param ``key_name`` was added to the instance rebuild API (v2.54),
    then it is able to reset instance key pair. It is worth noting that
    users within the same project are able to rebuild other user's instances
    in that project with a new keypair.
    If set ``key_name`` to None in API body, nova will unset the keypair of
    instance during rebuild.
