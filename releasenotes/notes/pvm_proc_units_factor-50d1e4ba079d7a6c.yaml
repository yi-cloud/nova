    ``proc_units_factor`` configuration option. This allows the operator to

    Previously the PowerVM driver would default to 0.5 physical processors per
    vCPU, which is the default from the pypowervm library. The default will now
    be 0.1 physical processors per vCPU, from the ``proc_units_factor``
    configuration option in the ``powervm`` configuration group.
