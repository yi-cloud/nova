    The ``delete_host`` command has been added in ``nova-manage cell_v2``
    to delete a host from a cell (host mappings).
    The ``force`` option has been added in ``nova-manage cell_v2 delete_cell``.
    If the ``force`` option is specified, a cell can be deleted
    even if the cell has hosts.
