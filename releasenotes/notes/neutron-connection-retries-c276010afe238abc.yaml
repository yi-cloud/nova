    A new config option ``[neutron]http_retries`` is added which defaults to
    3. It controls how many times to retry a Neutron API call in response to a
    HTTP connection failure. An example scenario where it will help is when a
    deployment is using HAProxy and connections get closed after idle time. If
    an incoming request tries to re-use a connection that is simultaneously
    being torn down, a HTTP connection failure will occur and previously Nova
    would fail the entire request. With retries, Nova can be more resilient in
    this scenario and continue the request if a retry succeeds. Refer to
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/1866937 for more details.
