    Throughout the Placement API, in microversion 1.15, 'last-modified' headers
    have been added to GET responses and those PUT and POST responses that have
    bodies. The value is either the actual last modified time of the most
    recently modified associated database entity or the current time if there
    is no direct mapping to the database. In addition,
    'cache-control: no-cache' headers are added where the 'last-modified'
    header has been added to prevent inadvertent caching of resources.
