    Added pagination support for migrations, there are four changes:

    - Add pagination support and ``changes-since`` filter for os-migrations
      API. Users can now use ``limit`` and ``marker`` to perform paginate query
      when listing migrations.
    - Users can also use ``changes-since`` filter to filter the results based
      on the last time the migration record was updated.
    - ``GET /os-migrations``,
      ``GET /servers/{server_id}/migrations/{migration_id}`` and
      ``GET /servers/{server_id}/migrations`` will now return a uuid value in
      addition to the migrations id in the response.
    - The query parameter schema of the ``GET /os-migrations`` API no longer
      allows additional properties.
