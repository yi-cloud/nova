upgrade:
  - |
    A sys-admin privsep daemon has been added and needs to be included in your
    rootwrap configuration.
  - |
    Calls to mount in the virt disk api no longer ignore the value of stderr.
  - |
    The nova-idmapshift binary has been removed. This has been replaced by
    internal functionality using privsep.
  - |
    The following commands are no longer required to be listed in your rootwrap
    configuration: blkid; blockdev; cat; chown; cryptsetup; dd; ebrctl; ifc_ctl;
    kpartx; losetup; lvcreate; lvremove; lvs; mkdir; mm-ctl; mount;
    nova-idmapshift; parted; ploop; prl_disk_tool; qemu-nbd; readlink; shred; tee;
    touch; umount; vgs; vrouter-port-control; and xend.
