    Added a new boolean configuration option
    ``[filter_scheduler]shuffle_best_same_weighed_hosts`` (default is False).

    Enabling it will spread instances between hosts that have the same weight
    according to request spec. It is mostly useful when the
    ``[filter_scheduler]host_subset_size`` option has default value of 1,
    but available hosts have the same weight (e.g. ironic nodes using resource
    classes). In this case enabling it will decrease the number of
    rescheduling events.

    On the other hand, enabling it will make packing of VMs on hypervizors
    less dence even when host weighing is disabled.
