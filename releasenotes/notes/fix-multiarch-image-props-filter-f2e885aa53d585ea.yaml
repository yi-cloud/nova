fixes:
  - The behaviour of ImagePropertiesFilter when using multiple architectures
    in a cloud can be unpredictable for a user if they forget to set the
    architecture property in their image.  Nova now allows the deployer to
    specify a fallback in ``[filter_scheduler]image_properties_default_architecture``
    to use a default architecture if none is specified.  Without this, it
    is possible that a VM would get scheduled on a compute node that does not
    support the image.
